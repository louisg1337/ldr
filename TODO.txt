- Make Request Functional
    - Make request viewable
        - Add a refresh
        - Add a check 
    - Save data for both sender + receipient (ASYNC? + FIREBASE)
        - [id, 'r'], R-receipient, S-sender, A-accepted
    - If accepted, change both relationship to true
        
THOUGHTS:
- Data Flow
    - Option 1
        - Check firebase for relationship data, retrieve it and save it to async storage
